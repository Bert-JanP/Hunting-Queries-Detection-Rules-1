//Maximum CVSS for Domain Admin Workstations. A favorite KQL wish list for all CISO ðŸ˜œ Secure your "keys" to your kingdom before it gets breached!

//KQL Code:

ExposureGraphNodes
| where NodeProperties.rawData.criticalityLevel contains "Domain Admin Workstations"
| where isnotnull(NodeProperties.rawData.highRiskVulnerabilityInsights)
| extend MaxCvssScore = toreal(NodeProperties.rawData.highRiskVulnerabilityInsights.maxCvssScore)
| sort by MaxCvssScore desc

// MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

// The KQL query focuses on identifying high-risk vulnerabilities on Domain Admin Workstations, which can be mapped to several MITRE ATT&CK techniques:

// T1078 - Valid Accounts:
// Description: Adversaries may use valid accounts to maintain access to systems.
// Relevance: Domain Admin Workstations are critical assets, and vulnerabilities here could be exploited to gain or maintain access.
// T1068 - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation:
// Description: Adversaries may exploit vulnerabilities to elevate their privileges.
// Relevance: High-risk vulnerabilities with high CVSS scores could be exploited for privilege escalation.
// T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services:
// Description: Adversaries may exploit vulnerabilities in remote services to execute code.
// Relevance: Vulnerabilities on Domain Admin Workstations could be targeted to exploit remote services.
// T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application:
// Description: Adversaries may exploit vulnerabilities in public-facing applications.
// Relevance: If Domain Admin Workstations have public-facing applications, these vulnerabilities could be exploited.
