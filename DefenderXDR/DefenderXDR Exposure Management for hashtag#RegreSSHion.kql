// https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7214788756237639680-rGkW/

//Use below KQL to determine your internet facing VM with OpenSSH and prioritize the following:
// - Access Control
// - Host-based Intrusion Prevention (E.g fail2ban)
// - SSH Configuration Hardening
// (E.g LoginGraceTime/MaxStartups/PerSourceMaxStartups)

// Refer to Splunk Mitigation Strategies for CVE-2024-6387
// Link: https://lnkd.in/gFPsbcaW

// MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

// Based on the operations performed in the KQL code, here are the relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques:

// T1133 - External Remote Services:
// Description: Adversaries may leverage external remote services to access and control systems over the internet.
// Relevance: The query identifies internet-facing devices, which could be targeted for remote access via services like OpenSSH.

// T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services:
// Description: Adversaries may exploit vulnerabilities in remote services to gain unauthorized access.
// Relevance: By identifying devices with OpenSSH, the query highlights potential targets for exploitation.

// T1078 - Valid Accounts:
// Description: Adversaries may use valid accounts to gain access to remote services.
// Relevance: OpenSSH is often used for secure remote access, and valid accounts could be used to log in to these services.

// T1046 - Network Service Scanning:
// Description: Adversaries may scan for network services to identify potential entry points.
// Relevance: The queryâ€™s focus on internet-facing devices and specific software (OpenSSH) aligns with the reconnaissance phase of identifying exploitable services.
