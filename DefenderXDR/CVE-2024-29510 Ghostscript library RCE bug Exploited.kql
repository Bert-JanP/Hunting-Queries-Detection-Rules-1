// CVE-2024-29510 Ghostscript library RCE bug Exploited
// https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7216125838516178945-R-rj/

// Artifex Ghostscript before 10.03.1 allows memory corruption, and SAFER sandbox bypass, via format string injection with a uniprint device. Ghostscript comes pre-installed on many Linux distributions and is used by various document conversion software.

// MDE KQL to check impacted Windows/Linux workstations:

DeviceTvmSoftwareInventory
| where SoftwareName contains "ghostscript" and SoftwareVersion != "10.03.1"

// MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
// This query aligns with the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques:

// T1082 - System Information Discovery: Attackers may use this technique to gather information about the software installed on a system, which can include identifying outdated or vulnerable versions1.
// T1518.001 - Software Discovery: This technique involves adversaries attempting to identify software installed on a system, which can help them understand the environment and identify potential targets2.
// By identifying devices with outdated versions of “ghostscript,” this query helps in detecting potential vulnerabilities that adversaries might exploit.
