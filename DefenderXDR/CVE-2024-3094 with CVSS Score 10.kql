//CVE-2024-3094 with CVSS Score 10/10

//Cyber defenders take note there is a supply chain compromise on the popular Linux XZ utils, if you have Linux running on Azure with Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC) enabled, run the below interim KQL to check if your Azure Cloud Linux servers are impacted and the latter KQL when Microsoft update their TVM database for this critical CVE.ðŸ«¡

//Interim KQL:

DeviceTvmSoftwareInventory 
| where SoftwareName contains "xz"
| where SoftwareVersion contains "5.6."

//KQL to use when Microsoft update their TVM database definitions:

DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities 
| where CveId == "CVE-2024-3094"
