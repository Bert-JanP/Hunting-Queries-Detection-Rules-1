Download your Teams PSTN usage report and open your report with Copilot Excel. Enter the prompt:
Which "caller number" appear the most time with different unique "Display Name" where the "Call Direction" is inbound and "Success" is No ?

To validate Copilot identified the correct vishing number "XXXXXXX2650", in DefenderXDR Advanced Hunting run the below KQL:

| where SenderFromAddress !contains "@"
