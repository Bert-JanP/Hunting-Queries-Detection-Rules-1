// Remote code execution exploit chain in OpenVPN

// CVE-2024-24974, CVE-2024-27903, CVE-2024-27459, and CVE-2024-1305 are four vulnerabilities affecting OpenVPN prior to version 2.6.10. A threat actor could exploit these vulnerabilities to launch arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges in kernel mode on a target system running a vulnerable version of OpenVPN. Many VPN services, network hardware, and other VPN software implement the open-source OpenVPN system. These services include ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Surfshark, ProtonVPN, and tunnelblick. All implementations of OpenVPN prior to version 2.6.10 are affected by these vulnerabilities, including downstream software and hardware.
