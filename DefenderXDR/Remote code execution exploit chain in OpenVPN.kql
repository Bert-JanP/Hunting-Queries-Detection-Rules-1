// Remote code execution exploit chain in OpenVPN

// CVE-2024-24974, CVE-2024-27903, CVE-2024-27459, and CVE-2024-1305 are four vulnerabilities affecting OpenVPN prior to version 2.6.10. A threat actor could exploit these vulnerabilities to launch arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges in kernel mode on a target system running a vulnerable version of OpenVPN. Many VPN services, network hardware, and other VPN software implement the open-source OpenVPN system. These services include ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Surfshark, ProtonVPN, and tunnelblick. All implementations of OpenVPN prior to version 2.6.10 are affected by these vulnerabilities, including downstream software and hardware.

// MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

// The query focuses on detecting VPN software, which can be associated with several MITRE ATT&CK techniques, particularly those related to Defense Evasion and Command and Control. Here are some relevant techniques:

// T1070.004 - Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion
// VPN software can be used to hide network traffic, making it harder to detect malicious activities.
// T1090 - Proxy
// VPNs are often used to route traffic through intermediary servers to obfuscate the origin of the traffic.
// T1573 - Encrypted Channel
// VPNs encrypt traffic, which can be used to secure communications and evade network monitoring.
// T1568 - Dynamic Resolution
// VPN services may use dynamic DNS to manage their infrastructure, which can be leveraged by attackers to evade detection.
