DefenderXDR Exposure Management for CVE-2024-3094
https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7180041278829580288-I4hU/

After reading so many infosec posts relating XZ, I decided to build this high precision KQL detection using the latest DefenderXDR exposure management capability to determine Azure internet facing Linux machines that has vulnerable compromised XZ and running SSHD which are susceptible to RCE attack. If you have this rule triggered, I would strongly suggest you quickly remediate your Linux VM.ðŸ«¡

let DeviceWithVulnerableXZ =
DeviceTvmSoftwareInventory 
| where SoftwareName contains "xz"
| where SoftwareVersion contains "5.6."
| distinct DeviceName;
let DevicewithSSHD =
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where ActionType == "ListeningConnectionCreated"
| where LocalPort == 22
| distinct DeviceName;
ExposureGraphNodes
| where NodeLabel == 'device' or (Categories has 'virtual_machine' and set_has_element(Categories, 'virtual_machine'))
// Condition: Internet Facing with vulnerable XZ and running SSHD
| where NodeProperties.rawData.isInternetFacing == true
| where NodeName has_any (DeviceWithVulnerableXZ)
| where NodeName has_any (DevicewithSSHD)
