// CVE-2024-38063 CVSS 9.8 Prioritization
// Linkedin Post: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/0x534c_defenderxdr-exposuremanagement-mde-activity-7229516269274685443-fTwM/
// An attacker can remotely exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted IPv6 packets to a target host. No user interaction is needed, making it a ‘0-click’ vulnerability. Only IPv6 packets can be used to exploit this critical vulnerability.

// It is important to identify privileged admin endpoints that are running IPv6 and are internet-facing. Prioritizing the patching of these endpoints is crucial, as they hold the keys to your systems.

// Using DefenderXDR Exposure Management and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint schema information, we are able to determine these important group of endpoints to be prioritize for patching.
