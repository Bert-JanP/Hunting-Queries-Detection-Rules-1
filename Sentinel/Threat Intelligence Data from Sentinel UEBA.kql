// The following KQL query extracts threat intelligence data for Entra users with a score of 5 or higher. This data helps you visualize the types of threats your cloud environment might be facing.

//Here's what you can potentially expect to uncover:
//- Scanner IP addresses
//- Malicious activity identified by honeypots
//- Microsoft Deep Research threat intelligence
//- Command and Control (C2) server communication attempts
//- Port scans
//- Phishing attempts
//- Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks
//- Hacking tools
//- Compromised Entra credential activity
//- Brute-force attacks
//- Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities
//- Email spam campaigns
//- Spoofing attempts

//By analyzing this threat intelligence, you can gain valuable insights and take steps to protect your cloud environment. ðŸ«¡

// MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

// Based on the KQL code, the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques might be relevant:

// Tactic: Reconnaissance
// Technique: Gather Victim Host Information (T1592)
// The query looks for threat intelligence indicators, which could include information about victim hosts.
// Tactic: Initial Access
// Technique: Drive-by Compromise (T1189)
// Threat intelligence indicators might include information about initial access methods like drive-by compromises.
// Tactic: Execution
// Technique: Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)
// The presence of threat intelligence indicators could suggest the use of scripting for execution.
// Tactic: Persistence
// Technique: Account Manipulation (T1098)
// High investigation priority records might indicate attempts to manipulate accounts for persistence.
// Tactic: Defense Evasion
// Technique: Indicator Removal on Host (T1070)
//Filtering for high-priority investigations could reveal attempts to evade detection by removing indicators.
// Tactic: Collection
// Technique: Data from Local System (T1005)
// Threat intelligence indicators might include data collection activities from local systems.
// Tactic: Exfiltration
// Technique: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041)
// High-priority investigations could indicate exfiltration activities over command and control channels.
