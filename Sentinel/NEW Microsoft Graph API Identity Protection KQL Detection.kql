// NEW Microsoft Graph API Identity Protection KQL Detection
// https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7194389287620997120-OVjs/

// With the new developments from Microsoft Entra Blog, it is now possible to identify user making an abnormally high number of calls to MS Graph and AAD Graph compared to that userâ€™s baseline, which will help identify both compromised users and insider threats scavenging for intel. As this is an offline detection, it may take up to 48 hours to surface in the reports and aggregate the user graph activities.

let SuspiciousGraphUserIP =
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(48h)
| where RiskEventTypes contains "suspiciousAPITraffic"
| distinct IPAddress;
MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(48h)
| where IPAddress has_any (SuspiciousGraphUserIP)


// MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

// Based on the KQL code, the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques are relevant:

// T1071.001 - Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols
// The detection of suspicious API traffic suggests the use of web protocols for communication, which falls under this technique.
// T1078 - Valid Accounts
// The use of valid accounts to perform suspicious activities, such as accessing Microsoft Graph, can be inferred from the logs.
// T1087.004 - Account Discovery: Cloud Account
// The query involves analyzing sign-in logs and activity logs, which can be related to discovering and using cloud accounts.
// T1070.004 - Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion
// If the suspicious activity involves attempts to delete logs or traces, this technique might be relevant.
// T1020 - Automated Exfiltration
// Suspicious API traffic might indicate automated data exfiltration attempts.
