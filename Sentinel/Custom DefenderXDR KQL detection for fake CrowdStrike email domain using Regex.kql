// MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

// The query primarily focuses on detecting phishing attempts, which can be mapped to the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques:

// Phishing (T1566):
// The query aims to identify phishing emails by detecting domains that mimic legitimate ones1.
// Spearphishing Link (T1566.002):
// By focusing on inbound emails with specific domain patterns, the query helps detect spearphishing attempts where attackers use lookalike domains1.
// Spearphishing Attachment (T1566.001):
// Although the query doesnâ€™t explicitly check for attachments, it can be extended to do so, thereby detecting spearphishing emails with malicious attachments1.
