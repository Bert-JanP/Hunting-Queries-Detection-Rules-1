// MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

// Based on the operations and objectives of the KQL code, the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques are relevant:

// T1071.001 - Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols:
// The query checks for IP addresses involved in suspicious activities, which could be related to the use of web protocols for command and control.
// T1070.004 - Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion:
// The query looks for threat intelligence indicators, which might include attempts to remove or alter logs to evade detection.
// T1040 - Network Sniffing:
// By analyzing network activity logs, the query could help detect attempts to capture network traffic.
// T1078 - Valid Accounts:
// The queryâ€™s focus on MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs might help identify the use of compromised accounts.
// T1020 - Automated Exfiltration:
// The query could detect automated data exfiltration attempts by monitoring suspicious IP addresses.
