// The query is looking for inbound emails with specific characteristics that could indicate a phishing attempt, especially with failed authentication checks.
// T1071.001 - Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols:
// The use of URLs in emails, particularly those pointing to forms.microsoft.com, can be indicative of attempts to use web protocols for malicious purposes.
// T1589.002 - Gather Victim Identity Information: Email Addresses:
// The focus on inbound emails and specific domains suggests an attempt to gather or exploit email addresses.
// T1078 - Valid Accounts:
// The failed authentication checks (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) could indicate attempts to use or spoof valid accounts.
