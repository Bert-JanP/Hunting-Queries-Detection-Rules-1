// MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

// Based on the operations and filters used in the KQL query, the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques are relevant:

// T1078: Valid Accounts - The query is looking for specific identities performing operations, which can be related to the use of valid accounts to perform actions1.
// T1098: Account Manipulation - The operation “Add application” could be associated with account manipulation activities, such as adding new applications or modifying existing ones2.
// T1566: Phishing - If the “Add application” operation is part of a broader phishing campaign to gain access to resources, this technique might be relevant3.
