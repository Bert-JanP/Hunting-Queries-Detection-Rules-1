// MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

// Based on the query, the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques are relevant:

// T1078 - Valid Accounts: The query focuses on authentication logs, which can help detect the use of valid accounts for unauthorized access.
// T1078.004 - Cloud Accounts: Specifically, the query targets Azure AD logs, which are related to cloud accounts.
// T1078.001 - Default Accounts: By filtering out specific trust types, the query might help identify the use of default or less secure accounts.
// T1556 - Modify Authentication Process: The use of ‚ÄúdeviceCode‚Äù as an authentication protocol could be related to attempts to modify or bypass standard authentication processes.
