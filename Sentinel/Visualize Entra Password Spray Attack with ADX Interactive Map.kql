| where ResultType == "50053" or ResultType == "50126"
| summarize PasswordSpray_Per_HalfHour=count() by bin (TimeGenerated, 30m)

//Replace the above blog's KQL with the below KQL to visualize Password Spray Attack locations.

// MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

// The KQL code you provided is designed to detect and visualize password spray attacks. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the associated MITRE ATT&CK techniques:

// Password Spray Detection:
// T1110.003 - Brute Force: Password Spraying: This technique involves attempting to gain unauthorized access to accounts by trying a few common passwords against many accounts. The first part of your KQL code detects password spray attacks by looking for specific result types (50053 and 50126) and summarizing the count of these events in 30-minute intervals.
// Geolocation of Password Spray Attacks:
// T1078 - Valid Accounts: The second part of your KQL code extends the detection by adding geolocation data to visualize where these password spray attempts are coming from. This helps in identifying potential sources of the attacks and can be useful for further investigation and response.
