// I just discovered a new threat actor group signature that started mounting aggressive spray about 2.5 weeks back on my tenant. If you run the below KQL on your Sentinel signin logs, you should probably see some hits on your tenant. Do shared your intel in the comment for community awareness if you observe it. üôè

// MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

// Based on the filters and the context of the query, the following MITRE ATT&CK techniques are relevant:

// T1078 - Valid Accounts:
// The query is looking for failed login attempts, which can be associated with attempts to use valid accounts with incorrect credentials.
// T1110 - Brute Force:
// The presence of multiple failed login attempts (ResultType 50126) suggests a brute force attack where an adversary is trying different passwords.
// T1212 - Exploitation for Credential Access:
// The specific user agent and application filters might indicate an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in the ‚ÄúOfficeHome‚Äù application or the browser to gain credential access.
// T1071 - Application Layer Protocol:
// The use of a specific user agent string can be related to the use of application layer protocols for communication, which might be part of the adversary‚Äôs tactics.
